<h3>Women in STEM fields call for engineering earlier interest</h3>
<i><p>Navraj Narula, Daily Free Press</i><p>


<p>Two decades ago, it may have been easy for one to guess a person’s major based on gender. Fast forward to the 21st century, and it’s not so easy. Statistics from the National Girls Collaborative Project in 2011 show that 50.4 percent of science and engineering bachelor’s degrees were earned by women. After graduation, however, the statistics are less promising. In the same year, the U.S. Department of Commerce found that 1 in 7 engineers are female. Though there has been progress, the conversation regarding women in STEM — science, technology, engineering and math — continues on in 2015, even in highly progressive and well-educated cities such as Boston.

<p>David Miller, a graduate student of psychology at Northwestern University, found in his research, published Feb. 17 in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, that science and engineering fields no longer leak more women than men in the bachelor’s-to-Ph.D. pipeline.

<p>“[The leaky pipeline metaphor] is the idea that women are more likely than men to leave science at multiple points after entering college,” Miller said. “Although this idea is commonly used to help understand gender differences in pursuing these fields, there’s been little evidence of gender differences in some of these transitions.”

<p>By looking at two large samples of college graduates in the United States, Miller said he was able to understand how these transitions took place over time.

<p>“Although men were more likely to go on and earn Ph.D.s in these fields in the 1970s and the 1980s, the gap [in terms of persistence rates] closed in the 1990s. So, this idea of the leaky pipeline is no longer accurate,” he said.

<p>Miller said men still outnumber women by 3-to-1 in what he labels pSTEM fields: physical science, engineering, technology and mathematics. However, he said that this is better explained by differences in college major choices and not persistence after college, due to the fact that women’s representation in pSTEM fields at the Ph.D. level is higher than it is at the bachelor’s level.


<p>Pamela Templer, an associate professor of biology in Boston University’s College of Arts and Sciences, said she started out as a music major in college, but quickly realized that although she was passionate about the subject, she wanted a career that was different.

<p>“I tried to get as much hands-on experience as possible as an undergraduate at the University of California so I could see what different careers are like. I enrolled in a ‘Natural History of California’ semester where we backpacked throughout the state of California to learn about the natural history and management of many different ecosystems,” she said. “I then was a [Research Experience for Undergraduates] student at the [Cary] Institute of Ecosystem Studies for a summer in New York state where I learned how to conduct research. I also studied in Costa Rica for a semester to learn about tropical biology.”

<p>Together, Templer said, those experiences made her realize just how much she loved to learn about the inner workings of forest ecosystems. At BU, she is teaching a class for the spring 2015 semester about forest ecosystems and said the number of female students is higher than the number of males in the class. In regard to gender bias surrounding the topic of women in STEM, Templer said the ratios are starting to improve, but said there are still more men than women in higher positions.

<p>“While there are generally equal numbers of female and male Ph.D. students, there are more male professors at senior level positions,” she said. “We need to do more to encourage women to get into STEM fields and to stay in them through their careers.”

<p>Miller said it is encouraging to see the gender persistence gaps closing at the Ph.D. level. However, he said it is a concern that persistence at the bachelor’s level has been decreasing. A solution, he suggests, would be to place more emphasis on encouraging women to pursue science and engineering fields earlier in their education.

<p>“My alma mater, Harvey Mudd College, encouraged women to join computer science fields … Harvey Mudd’s president, Maria Klawe, led these efforts,” Miller said. “For instance, course revisions emphasized how computation can be used to help solve social problems such as climate change or modeling of infectious diseases.”


<p>Samantha Karam, a sophomore in CAS studying computer science, said her father works with computers and that he has encouraged her interest in his work.

<p>“I have always been drawn to math and logic,” she said. “Also, with computer science, I get to see all of my efforts pay off in the most tangible way. The gratification from making a program run correctly is unbeatable. Computer science [seems] like the perfect fit.”

<p>Flor de Maria Blaszczyk, a post-doctoral research assistant in CAS, specializing in neutrino physics and proton decay studies for the physics department, said she discovered her perfect fit in a quantum mechanics lecture class.

<p>“When I was an undergrad [at University of Paris XI in France], I had my first quantum mechanics lecture. It was puzzling, but it made me want to understand more,” she said. “I had a seminar given to me by a female professor, and she was very passionate about neutrinos. I don’t know if it is the fact that she was female, or the topic, or both, but it lighted a spark in me. It was such an interesting particle, and I had to learn more about it.”

<p>As a female physicist, Blaszczyk said there has been a slow increase of women in STEM.

<p>“From what I discussed with other women, they seem to be intimidated. ‘Why did you choose that? Isn’t that a field where there are only guys?’ I don’t know if it’s something social or something you see on TV. There is some sort of subconscious image that physicist are guys, and biologists are girls, but I don’t know where that comes from,” she said.

<p>Despite potential gender biases that may hinder women’s progress in STEM fields, Miller said it is essential for others to become more aware of topics surrounding diversity in science and engineering fields.

<p>“Understanding and changing potential gender biases should remain an important goal for educators and policy makers,” he said. “Gender equality in numbers doesn’t necessarily mean gender equality in opportunities.”<p><br><br>

<h3>Residents gather to celebrate Supreme Court same-sex marriage decision</h3>
<i><p>Navraj Narula, Daily Free Press</i><p>

<p>Following a 5-4 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to legalize same-sex marriage across all 50 states, Boston-area residents celebrated Friday night at the Massachusetts State House at a gathering co-hosted by various organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders.

<p>Those in attendance waved small flags featuring rainbow colors and the equality symbol. Many brought their partners and children, cheering in celebration of the occasion.

<p>U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of several leaders who spoke on the State House steps, wore a rainbow feather scarf and commended the state of Massachusetts for starting a revolution.

<p>“We started it here and it spread across this nation,” Warren said. “Eleven years ago, we brought equality to this country. This is a moment of celebration and of love … a moment in which we say we understand equal means equal all across this country. I look at this way: eleven years ago Massachusetts, today U.S.A., and tomorrow the whole world.”

<p>Massachusetts was the first state to recognize same-sex marriages in 2004.

<p>Boston Mayor Martin Walsh expressed support for the Supreme Court decision and called it a “victory for democracy, for family, for community and for love.”

<p>“This decision marks a milestone on our nation’s journey to become a more perfect union,” he said in a Friday statement. “I honor Jim Obergefell and all the plaintiffs and advocates who fought not only for their own rights but for the rights of all Americans to marry the person they love and enjoy equal protection under the law.”

<p>Rev. Irene Monroe spoke to the crowd about how every committed relationship deserves the right for public recognition and legal protection and reminded those gathered that the Supreme Court decision does not completely end inequality.

<p>“After today’s landmark decision, [groups] are working on a 50 state plan to pass religion freedom restoration acts to legalize discrimination against LGBTQ people and trying to roll back the progress we’re working on,” she said. “We’ve already seen in states like Louisiana, North Carolina and Michigan to name a few.”

<p>Several Boston-area residents expressed varying views about the impact the Supreme Court decision will have on the nation.

<p>Sandra Musique, 38, a representative from the Boston Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, said she came to the celebration to show solidarity for the gay community and recognize the effects of the decision.

<p>“In Massachusetts, it’s hard to see an instant difference, but the fact that I can go anywhere and be married? That’s cool,” she said. “But I am more concerned about people who were in places like Ohio or people in states where it’s been banned like Colorado. They can now live their lives the way they see fit without interference from bigots.”

<p>Renate Pyhel, 57, of Cambridge, said she is proud to celebrate the gains so far for human rights, but also apprehensive about the future.

<p>“I tremble with trepidation that there will be challenges to it [the decision], but it will endure,” she said. “They [those against gay rights] will try to whittle away using the pretense of religious freedoms. There have been cases like the Hobby Lobby where corporations have maintained their latitude at certain matters is allowed by their presumed religious freedoms.”

<p>Ariel Valdes, 24, of Lynn, said she is excited for the future generation to come.

<p>“It’s going to affect the [LGBT] community positively,” she said. “Many youth will see the support that marriage [has made]. It’s such a happy day for many people.”<p>

<h3>African Presidential Center director looks into reasons behind closing</h3>
<i><p>Navraj Narula, Daily Free Press</i><p>

<p>Charles Stith, the director of Boston University’s African Presidential Center and the former U.S. ambassador to Tanzania, held a press conference Friday to explore the reasons behind the center’s closure and elaborate on its mission.

<p>The center will close its doors on June 30, The Daily Free Press reported on April 22. At the time of the announcement, BU spokesman Colin Riley said the reason behind the closing was a financial one. The APC, which operates off grants and funding from external entities, was not able to raise enough money over the past year to stay open, Riley said.

<p>Stith said BU President Robert Brown’s administration was actually aware of the center’s closing earlier than this academic year. At the press conference, Stith read an email he received April 16 from someone he identified as a high-ranking BU official.

<p>“‘You brought something of great value to BU, asking for very little in return. On the other hand, this is no great surprise,’” Stith read. “‘As you no doubt remember … I was personally offered “30 pieces of silver” to shut down your operation. I was utterly appalled … I am happy and a bit surprised that you were able to survive at BU for seven more years after the initial planned assassination of your program.’”

<p>He also brought up BU’s claim that they reached out to the State Department to look for funding for the center. Stith, however, said he had never heard of the university doing that for the APC. Brown, Stith said, is closing the center because he believes that it is not worth maintaining.

<p>“The issues raised relative to APC are just the tip of the iceberg. President Brown and the Board of Trustees have a decision to make,” he said. “Do they want to continue the charade that nothing is amiss and have the [plethora] of facts come to light, offense by offense, and drag the university through the mud, as well as [drag] the city and state? Or will they do the right thing and self-correct?”

<p>Stith said the closing of the center is part of a greater trend in the leadership decisions at BU.

<p>“While the focus of the recent coverage has been the closure of the African Presidential Center, I think it is important to understand that President Brown’s action against APC is reflective of [a pattern] of hostility and discrimination against the African-Americans that has typified his tenure as president,” he said.

<p>Stith said there are fewer African-Americans in BU’s faculty today than in 1976, during which two percent were African-American. Additionally, Stith said, the university is not doing enough in offering admissions to African American students.

<p>“This record is all the more egregious for an institution that numbers among its alums Martin Luther King Jr., Barbara Jordan and Edward Brooke and members of the Mandela family,” he said. “Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would be ashamed of BU’s record and we should too.”

<p>Stith also addressed the controversy surrounding the tweets of Saida Grundy, an incoming BU sociology professor. He pointed out that she has apologized for her remarks as well as the distraction it has caused within the university. At this point, he said, Grundy has little power to affect BU in any way, while Brown does.

<p>“Robert Brown … has an enormous amount of power,” he said. “I find it ironic that this very real threat to African-Americans at this university has not gotten nearly the national attention that a perceived theoretical threat to white interest has received … [African-Americans’] interests continually get treated as secondary in any discussion.”

<p>Several students attended the press conference to show their support for the APC.

<p>Jaimee McGruder, a sophomore in the College of Communication, said a lot of students are unaware of the existence of the APC.

<p>“This university doesn’t really do anything to promote it or let us know it exists or what resources are here,” McGruder said. “I thought it was really important to be here to support it … to hear what their statement was.”

<p>Amina Egal, a sophomore in the Sargent College of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences and a member of the People of Color Coalition, said she attended the conference to get a better glimpse of the issues that will be discussed in the future.

<p>“I kind of wanted to know more information from the ambassador himself and the future of APC and what the university is doing to talk about this issue and what [the university] is going to be doing in the future,” she said.

<p>Fatima Mohie-Eldin, a senior in the College of Arts and Sciences, said she was grateful to attend Stith’s talk, despite the fact that she is graduating.

<p>“I’m leaving as a senior so a lot of people ask me why I’m still interested. It’s about what kind of school I’m leaving behind. How many other schools can say they have a center like this? I was so upset when I heard it was closing,” she said. “Even though I’m on my way out, I still want to show my support and I hope that it can stay open.”<p>
