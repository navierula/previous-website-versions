<p>A lot of people wonder where I am from, so here's the mini gist: I am Indian-Pakistani by nature, but was born and raised in Bangkok, Thailand. For 18 years, I called Krung-Thep my home. I learned how to speak Thai, swim depths well beyond the size of my body into the Pacific, and chose to adopt a <a href="https://medium.com/@NavieRula/joey-697e0ca2ccab">dog</a> who now spends her time in heaven. I currently reside in Boston, Massachusetts. I admire this city--its people, its intelligence, and its courage--more than most places I've previously visited.</p>

<p>While in Bangkok, I attended International Community School (K-12). <b>I was constantly told by my teachers that I had an aptitude for the English language...and it was true!</b> I constructed sentences free of grammatical error, understood the semantics behind idioms, and even worked to develop my own stories. I read books diurnaly, without regret. My current favorite is: <i>Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</i> by Jonathan Safran Foer. My dreams and thoughts soon began to intermingle Punjabi, Thai, and English.</p>

<p>So, when it came time to indicate a major in college, the task was easy for me. Having loved working with children for four years back home, I declared a dual major in English Literature and English Education at Boston University. As part of my curriculum, my advisor informed me that <b>I was required by both programs to complete either two math or computer science electives.</b> Of course, I felt uneasy after hearing this news. I had not practiced anything related to math in a while and felt "rusty." However, I wanted to complete the requirements for my two degrees. So, I signed up to take CS105: Introduction to Databases and Data Mining.</p>

<p><b>So begins my long, challenging, and wonderful journey with computer science.</b></p>

<p>I was surprised to have fallen in love with the subject, perhaps because I did not expect that I would. Unlike most majors who may have started out learning the basics of programming via Python or Java, I started off with query construction. The task appeared to be simple and routine at the beginning of the semster, but I soon found that I could complicate things and in turn, return more telling results. I worked with my class teammates to predict the longevity of male fruitflies by means of numeric estimation using Weka. The task involved transferring information from a public dataset to a .csv file, so as to ease the process of manipulating data in Python.</p>

<p>For the first time (given multiple years of schooling!), I learned something new and I am thankful that CS105 only served as the beginning. After a summer of exploring academia in <a href = "http://www.bu.edu/washington/2014/07/08/navraj-narula/">Washington, DC</a>, I came back to college the fall of my junior year and enrolled in CS111: Introduction to Computer Science I. This is the first class required for all computer science majors at Boston University. After taking several more classes, <b>I declared my <a href="http://www.bu.edu/cs/undergraduate/computer-science-major/">major</a></b> in the subject the following semester.</p>

<p>Computer Science offered me something English Literature and English Education could not: <b>true
	education.</b> In my English classes, I somehow felt as if there was something in me that always knew what to do: read carefully, criticize constructively, and support evidence with analysis. The process was so inherent to me; I hardly ever had to work to think about it. I ended up feeling bored. The best decision for me at that point was to shift my focus. I tried my hand at computer science and regret nothing, not even the sleepless nights...because they were spent working with strangers (turned into friends!) to solve the most difficult of problems. 
	I learned so much more in one hour struggling to debug my parsing function than I ever would have writing an essay I most likely already knew how to write.</p>

<p><b>I wake up everyday thinking: "I will learn something new today," and I have yet to be wrong!</b> Given my background, the transition to computer science has not always been a walk in the park. However, it is doable and I am close to conquering this jungle I've thrown myself into. <b>I am challenged and feel ever so fulfilled after I have overcome my obstacles. This is what I had longed for my college experience to be the minute I stepped foot into the United States...and now it is!</b> Taking risks <i>can</i> be good.<p>

<p>I am fascinated by many areas of my new field: the construction of programming langauges, elaborating on theories by means of providing proofs, and software engineering given a supportive team-based environment. As a database guru, I am also concerned with developing my own relational databases. I work directly from MySQLWorkbench and am currently learning how to use Tableu to visualize a final presentation of my discoveries.</p>

<p><b>I aim to be a software engineer, a data scientist, or a technical writer. I might already even be there.</b></p>
