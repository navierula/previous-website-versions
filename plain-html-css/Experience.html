  <b><p>Basics</p></b>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <b><li>College:</b> Boston University<br><br></li>
  <b><li>Majors:</b> Computer Science, English Literature, and English Education<br><br></li>

  <b><p>Work</p></b>
  <p><u>Technical Intern - <a href="https://www.cctvcambridge.org">CCTV: Cambridge Community Television</a> (July 2015 - present)</u></p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li>As a computer software enthusiast, I am grateful for the chance to be able to assist CCTV community members in all-to-most technical areas: programming, image/content editing, and general internet navigation. I provide one-on-one assistance during my personal lab hours and have yet failed to leave each person with an easy-to-understand (yet detailed!) solution if they should so encounter similar issues at home.</li><br>

    <li>Classes I have personally taken to encourage my own learning at CCTV include Edit I, in which I mastered the beginning stages of Final Cut Pro. My goal is to eventually digitalize my storytelling efforts on film and apply concepts learned from a linear algebra course to move my still-set animations.</li>
  </ul>

        <p><u>Course Grader - <a href="http://www.bu.edu/cs/">Boston University Computer Science Department</a> (January 2015 - present)</p></u>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">

<li>I serve as a grading assistant for CS105: Introduction to Databases and Data Mining. Under the direction <a href="http://cs-people.bu.edu/dgs/"> Dr. Sullivan</a>, I provide numeric grades for assignments related to Python programming, SQL query plans, and Weke data mining techniques. </li><br>

<li>This is the course that encouraged my major in Computer Science.</li></ul>

    <p><u>Features Lead & Contributor - <a href="http://dailyfreepress.com">The Daily Free Press</a> (September 2014 - present)</p></u>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li>Journalism is best learned from experience and I believe I received a taste for this industry by: conducting weekly interviews in efforts to add speech to my pieces, following current news streams to determine what makes a newsworthy pitch, and (soon-to-be) managing to-be-printed content in the editorial process.</li><br>

    <li>I mainly write feature pieces, but occasionally work with hard news. My portfolio can be found <a href="http://dailyfreepress.com/author/navralie/">here.</a></li>
  </ul>

      <p><u>Desktop Support Assistant - <a href="http://www.bu.edu/cs/">Boston University Computer Science Department</a> (May 2013 - present)</p></u>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">

<li>I have been working as a systems administrator for both Windows and Linux machines for close to three years. I reboot machines when they are down and report any further actions to be taken to my supervisor, implementing them on my own if necessary. </li><br>

<li>During my shift, I am in charge of general maintenance of the undergraduate computer science laboratory. Aside from making sure guests adhere to lab policies, my core administrative duties include creating computer science accounts for students and providing them with departmental information regarding their courses and available office hours.</li></ul>

     <p><u>Research Intern - <a href="https://www.edreform.com">CER: The Center for Education Reform</a> (June 2014 - August 2014)</p></u>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">

<li>Issues surrounding teacher quality, treatment of minority populations, and common core procedures are still evident in classrooms. Interning at CER allowed me to gain more insights into these issues first-hand and pushed me to advocate for the rights of my past and future students.</li><br>

<li>During my time in the capital, I maintained and updated databases with information pertaining to all charter schools within the USA and contributed to Edspresso by writing blog posts related to educational policy and popular opinion regarding charters. </li><br>

<li>I also attended events at educational policy institutions, serving as a representative for CER. Nearing the end of the summer, my fellow interns and I planned our own event featuring self-selected panelists and opened up invitation to all interns in the metro area interested in pursuing a career in educational policy. We had an excellent turnout.</li></ul>




  <b><p>Other Experiences</p></b>

       <p><u>Vice President of Internal Affairs - <a href="http://www.bu.edu/cas/">Boston University College of Arts and Sciences</a> (September 2014 - May 2015)</p></u>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">

<li>College government aims to connect the student body to their administration; transparency regarding funding issues was something that my team and I brought to light as we sought to allocate our money not only towards infrastructure, but also to budding student organizations. As an international student, I also aimed to shed light on issues regarding adaptation, academics, and employment and I will continue to do so in various ways (via writing mostly) to encourage more discussion on this topic.</li><br>

<li>Besides politics, I kept tab of every weekly meeting by digitizing my notes and prepared the agenda for our team's next one based on tasks already completed and ones we needed to consider for the future. I also assisted in the planning of events such as panel discussions and a formal end-of-semester get together for students enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences.</li></ul>

       <p><u>Peer Mentor - <a href="http://www.bu.edu/cas/">Boston University College of Arts and Sciences</a> (September 2014 - December 2014)</p></u>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">

<li>As a first generation college student, I learned to navigate the entire college system on my own; from what classes to take given my interests, what resources to seek out when I felt as if my academic advisors were not providing with adequate membership, and how to manage my time efficiently (balancing academia and on-campus club involvement). I did not come on a campus tour before my arrival to Boston University, but I bet I could tell you more about my college than a staff member who has been here for 10+ years.</li><br>

<li>My wealth of information encouraged me to apply to be a peer mentor, but it was the friendships that I made throughout the process that made me realize what a good decision this was for me. To my first-years (Class of 2018): You made every Monday of our time together special. Thank you!</li><br>

<li>Tasks I completed including the development of ice-breakers, meeting one-on-one with each student to assist with anything they might need, and creating an original lesson plan based on student leadership. I made my solo presentation to the class at the end of the semester.</li></ul>



  <b><p>Volunteering</p></b>

         <p><u>Trail Volunteer - <a href="http://cumberlandtrail.org/website/">Cumberland Trail Conference</a> (March 2014)</p></u>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">

  <li>I am proud to say that I was involved in constructing a trail that will one day extend from New York state to Florida. I learned to use hammers, maddocks, and various other digging tools to build <a href= "http://www.bu.edu/today/2014/alternative-spring-breaks-crossville-tennessee/">this</a> trail for recreational purposes. A week working in this enviroment was too short - the people I was surrounded by were dreamers, determined to make their dreams happen. </li></ul>
