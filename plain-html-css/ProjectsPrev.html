<u><p>Teammates:</p></u> 
	<p>Anyssa Buchanan, Adis Husejinovic<p>
	<p><u>Details:</u></p>
		<p>We received our data from the Journal of Statistics Education. Our data concerns the reproduction costs of male fruit flies in terms of reduced longevity. There are 2 types of male fruit flies within this data set. One type has 1 or 8 newly inseminated female partners, while the other type has 0 partners. The longevity of male fruit flies was compared between these two types.</p>
<p>Previous studies have indicated reduced longevity among sexually active female fruit flies. Essentially, the aim of this study is to conclude whether or not male fruit flies also have reduced longevity due to increased sexual activity.</p>
<p>Looking at this data set, we have decided to use longevity as our output based on the other attributes. We used data mining, specifically numeric estimation, to determine a model that our data can be tested on. In order to prep our data, we used Python and SQLite. Lastly, we used SQLite to aid in our data visualization process.</p>

<p><u>Details:</p></u>
<p>I learned HTML, CSS, and MySQL in the span of two weeks to create a web application that allows users to create a profile and share what destinations they would like to travel. Establishing a database connection in Python, site viewers are able to see most popular destinations by criteria including age and gender.</p>

<p><b>Relational Databases</p></b>

<p>Below is the first of many more to come!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/navierula/Relational-Databases/tree/master/Help%20Wanted">Help Wanted</a>
<p><u>Details:</p></u>
<p>All in good fiction: Due to the heavy amount of crime plaguing many nations, good-doers such as policemen, firemen, and federal bureau agents have not found it feasible to keep track of every mis-happening. Furthermore, superhuman abilities have begun to emerge. By the year 2024, at least 15% of all humans will have a power. Some use these as gifts; others as curses&mdash;and it is those who use their powers for unpleasantness that have caused a 79% increase in crime rates all over the world.</p>
<p>In an effort to cleanse each community from terror, HELP WANTED offers itself as a service to organizations affiliated with the government, police force, and any other registered institution that seeks extra assistance in solving a crime. Queries can be made to search for specific superheroes, archenemies, powers, and crimes. A listing of all information regarding all humans on the planet is also available.</p>

<b><p>Future Plans</b></p>

<p>Last semester (Fall 2015), I enrolled in a class on probability in computing. In this class, I revisited the matplot library and was introduced to pandas (via Python). I found it really helpful to visualize distributions (binomial, multinomial, geometric, etc.) in graphs, but am hoping to extend these tools further to more interesting datasets. If you have any ideas or would like to work with me, please do not hesistate to get in touch!</p>
