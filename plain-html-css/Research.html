<b><p>As of January 2016</b></p>
<p> Currently, I serve as Data Storytelling Research Assistant under Maggie Mulvihill. I will update this page as I begin to develop my own projects.</p>

<b><p>Preface</b></p>

<p>There are a number of topics that I am interested in. For that reason, I have chosen to take on independent research regarding areas I might possibly want to pursue. All work displayed on are of my own initiative.<p>

<p><u>Motivation/Abstract:</u></p>



<p>As a millennial citizen dependent on communication via technology, I have developed my own sentiment analysis model. Its blueprint is generalized enough so that it may used to classify any text; though, I have chosen to focus on popular hashtags trending via Twitter. I have discovered that my system classifies accurately, despite the numerical deviation from calculating what I term the &quot;sentiment score&quot; when pitting one model (i.e. &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;negative&quot;) against a dataset containing similar tweets. Improvements are to be made in regards to this aspect; however, it still suffices to say that the model, keeping in mind its purpose, succeeds.</p>

<p><u>Motivation/Abstract:</u></p>

<p>Stephen Rachman, the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies in the Department of English at Michigan State University, makes note of the fact that Edgar Allan Poe's &quot;Al-Aaraaf&quot; (1829) sits like a bookend near the beginning, or perhaps the end, of his career. The same can be said for &quot;Israfel&quot; (1831), another poem written shortly after &quot;Al-Aaraaf.&quot; It has also not been read as much as &quot;Annabel Lee,&quot; &quot;The Bells,&quot; or &quot;The Raven.&quot; Though both these early 19th century have not been eyed critically by literary aficionados, this does not mean that these poems should fall into the category of &quot;nevermore.&quot; The fact of the matter is plain and simple: Poe wrote all his works with meaning and intent.</p>

<p>In my piece, I offer an article-length analysis of &quot;Al-Aaraaf&quot; and &quot;Israfel.&quot; I will also speak to Poe's insistence on incorporating non-traditional elements within his writing in efforts to further emphasize that truths regarding death, life, or the in-between can be found in places deemed unusual.</p>
