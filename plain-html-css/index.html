<p>My name is Navraj (Navie) Narula and I am a graduate student at <a href="https://www.columbia.edu">Columbia University</a> studying computer science with a special focus on natural langauge processing and computational journalism. I completed my undergraduate degree at 
<a href="https://www.columbia.edu">Boston University</a>, where I also studied computer science
along with English literature and secondary education.</p>

<p>I am passionate about examining large datasets for interesting stories and coming up with algorithms to perfect textual analysis. I am also interested in machine learning as it pertains to pattern recognition and user behavior.</p>

<p>This year, I built an application that detects the sentiment of text and translates it song, 



<p>For that reason, I am choosing to apply to graduate programs in computer science/engineering. I am most interested in database design and data analytics. In my spare time, I create relational databases and develop front-end tools to access them for the purpose of information retrieval. I am also fascinated by algorithms, particular those pertaining to graph theory and how they can be implemented to solve problems. My <a href= "Research.html">research portfolio</a> is also documented on this page.</p>

<p>Deciding to pursue my passion mid-junior year has led me to this conclusion: <i>Nothing</i> has to remain confusing. I have made the greatest decision of all: to continue to study what I love! I am happily exploring classes, research areas, and events pertaining to computer science. My curiosity encourages me to ask questions, re-read, and despite all barriers: push through.</p>
