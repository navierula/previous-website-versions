<p>My name is Navraj Narula and I am an undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.bu.edu">Boston University</a> majoring in English Literature, Secondary Education, and Computer Science. I enjoy writing creatively on multiple levels, given my various academic fields of interest. Yet I constantly find myself to be most enamored with syntax as it relates to programming languages.</p>
<p>For that reason, I am choosing to apply to graduate programs in computer science/engineering. I am most interested in database design and data analytics. In my spare time, I create relational databases and develop front-end tools to access them for the purpose of information retrieval. I am also fascinated by algorithms, particular those pertaining to graph theory and how they can be implemented to solve problems. My <a href= "Research.html">research portfolio</a> is also documented on this page.</p>

<p>Deciding to pursue my passion mid-junior year has led me to this conclusion: <i>Nothing</i> has to remain confusing. I have made the greatest decision of all: to continue to study what I love! I am happily exploring classes, research areas, and events pertaining to computer science. My curiosity encourages me to ask questions, re-read, and despite all barriers: push through.</p>
